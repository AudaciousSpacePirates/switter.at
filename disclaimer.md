# Unencrypted Data Warning
Because Mastodon data isn't encrypted, everyone on the internet will eventually have your data.

Sorry. Not much we can do, except encrypt everything, and OpenPGP is a bit unwieldy.

We'll eliminate this problem as soon as we can.

# Zero Privacy  
Mastodon allows an admin to read all of your private messages.
(Questions about why? Discussion link(s) and Github/issues page.)

Never say anything via direct message that you don't want accidentally becoming public.
The admins _super_ pinkie promise not to do bad things with this power, but it's best to trust hard encryption, not phalanges fiddling.

We're working on getting end-to-end encryption set up, but we're not there yet.
If our server gets hacked, the internet at large could see your private posts and all your direct messages.

We're working hard with the developers of Mastodon to fix these, and other, problems with the security model.
We welcome you to open a feature request or bug report on our Github issues page, and we'll do our best to respond if you ping our admin/moderator/etc via Mastodon.
We do this in our spare time, please be patient as we respond to our sudden influx of users.

# mastodon is federated
By using federation, we connect with other _instances_, which are other servers running a Mastodon-compatible protocol.

Federation allows us to all talk to eachother, but have our own rules internally.
It's like a pool party on the friendly side of the street.

Federation also adds some very real dangers that you should be aware of.  

## federated point of failure
When Facebook/Twitter/etc get hacked, everyone knows about it eventually.  

Someone cracking open Facebook is big news.  
You might be reading this thanks to publicity of that sort.  

Unfortunately, on Mastodon, any server that your server federates with retains some data on you, so if _any_ of the Mastodon instances get hacked (or are operated by malicious individuals, eg law enforcement or a nation/state actor), your data is exposed, and you may never know.

## privacy of the public/private/unlisted/direct setting
A public post can be seen by anyone with a web browser.
A private post can only be seen by your fediverse followers.

An _unlisted_ post won't show up on as many search engines.
A _direct message_ will only be seen by you, the admin, and the other people you add (via username) to the conversation.

## who switter.at federates with
_insert list of federated servers here_
(_update this every time you finalize a list or add/update/remove_)

## why switter.at doesn't federate with some instances
_explain the rules for why an instance would get removed from the previously stated list_

# Here's the awesome part
Here on switter, you'll never be shadowbanned for sexual content.

We encourage your sexual self-expression, and advise that the primary rule is consent in all things.

<add extra marketing/flavour text as necessary to get the point across>
