# Single Authoritative Source
Without a guiding hand, chaos reigns.

Never duplicate data. Only cache it.

# Rules and Guidelines
Know the difference between the two.

Rules are intended to be broken only by trained professionals, or by citizens after careful consideration in the context of a life-threatening situation.

Guidelines help us get alone in friendly contexts when no emergency is currently happening.

# <3 Your System Administrator
Spend a few minutes reading up on your instance system administrator.

You should know your admins.
You should know who is steering the digital ship.

If you don't trust them based on their public profile,
why would you trust them with your private data?
Doing so is self-destructive behavior.

Know thy admin.
